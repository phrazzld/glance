# Setup Testing Framework

## Goal
Add the testify package dependencies to go.mod and set up the initial test structure with basic CLI execution tests.

## Implementation Approach
I'll add the github.com/stretchr/testify/assert and github.com/stretchr/testify/mock packages to the project's dependencies and create the foundation for testing. This will enable both unit testing with assertions and mocking capabilities for isolated testing of components.

The approach will be:
1. Add testify dependencies to go.mod using go get
2. Create a simple initial test function that verifies the CLI can be executed (without testing actual functionality yet)
3. Set up the basic test structure that future tests will build upon

## Reasoning
I chose this approach because:

1. The testify package provides a clean, expressive API for assertions and mocking which aligns with modern Go testing practices.
2. Starting with a minimal end-to-end test ensures we have the basic test infrastructure in place before diving into more complex unit tests.
3. This approach follows the RFT-01 acceptance criteria from the plan, which specifically mentions introducing testify/assert and testify/mock with basic CLI execution tests.
4. Establishing the testing framework first creates a solid foundation for all subsequent refactoring tasks, reducing risk by enabling immediate verification of changes.
