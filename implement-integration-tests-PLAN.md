# Implement Integration Tests

## Goal
Create integration tests in main_test.go that verify the interaction between packages using test directories. These tests will ensure the different components of the application work together correctly.

## Implementation Approach
1. **Extend Existing End-to-End Tests:** Build upon the existing main_test.go framework, which already has some end-to-end test scaffolding.

2. **Create Module-to-Module Integration Tests:** Develop targeted tests that verify interactions between specific combinations of packages:
   - Config + Filesystem: Test that configuration settings correctly influence filesystem operations
   - Filesystem + LLM: Test the end-to-end file processing workflow
   - LLM + UI: Test that LLM operations properly report progress via UI components
   - Config + LLM: Test API key handling and prompt template loading

3. **Use Test Fixtures and Mocks:** Create a test directory structure with sample files and mock LLM responses to test the integration points without requiring actual API calls.

## Key Reasoning
I've selected this approach because:

1. **Builds on Existing Foundation:** The project already has end-to-end tests in main_test.go, which provides a good starting point for more comprehensive integration testing.

2. **Focused Test Coverage:** By targeting specific interactions between pairs of packages, we can identify integration issues more precisely.

3. **Testability Without External Dependencies:** Using mocks and test fixtures allows us to test integration points without relying on external services like the Gemini API.

4. **Alignment with Project Structure:** This approach respects the existing package boundaries while testing how they work together.
