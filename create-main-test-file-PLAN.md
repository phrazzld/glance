# Create Main Test File

## Goal
Create a comprehensive main_test.go file with end-to-end tests that verify GLANCE.md creation and behavior with a test directory structure.

## Implementation Approach
I'll enhance the existing main_test.go file with more comprehensive end-to-end tests that verify the actual generation of GLANCE.md files under various conditions. The implementation will:

1. Create a structured test directory with multiple levels, some files, and a .gitignore
2. Build a test helper function to set up this directory structure consistently
3. Implement tests for multiple scenarios:
   - Normal generation of GLANCE.md
   - Force flag behavior (regeneration of existing files)
   - Proper handling of .gitignore patterns
   - Propagation of changes to parent directories

This approach will focus on testing the primary functionality of the application from an external perspective, without reaching into implementation details.

## Reasoning
I selected this approach because:

1. **Complete Verification**: Testing GLANCE.md creation with a realistic directory structure will provide confidence that the core functionality works correctly before we begin more invasive refactoring.

2. **Reusable Structure**: Creating test helpers to set up the directory structure will make it easier to maintain these tests and add more test cases in the future.

3. **External Interface Testing**: Testing through the command-line interface ensures we're verifying the behavior users actually experience, not just internal implementations.

4. **Alignment with Existing Code**: We already have a partial implementation of main_test.go, so enhancing it is more efficient than starting from scratch.

5. **No API Calls**: The design avoids making actual Gemini API calls by using a mock/stub API response when appropriate to keep tests fast and reliable.
