# Vision

## One-Liner
CLI tool that recursively scans directories and generates high-quality glance.md summaries using LLM failover chains.

## North Star
The go-to developer tool for instant codebase comprehension — every directory self-documenting, always current, zero maintenance.

## Key Differentiators
- Multi-provider LLM failover (Gemini, OpenRouter/Grok) for reliability
- Smart regeneration via modification time checking
- Respects .gitignore, handles large files gracefully
- Zero config for basic use, customizable prompts for advanced use

## Target User
Developers who want quick, automated documentation of directory contents across codebases.

## Current Focus
Rock-solid reliability, output quality, and correctness. Fix known bugs, clean up technical debt.
