# Evaluating Engineering Complexity for a CLI Utility Tool

## Context
Glance is a CLI tool that generates markdown summaries of directories using LLMs. It's designed to be used primarily as a pre-commit hook for other projects. Looking at our TODO list, we've implemented and are planning several engineering practices commonly associated with larger production systems:

1. Comprehensive test coverage with mocks
2. Interface-based abstractions (recently switched from function variables to interfaces)
3. Security hardening (path traversal protection, file permission handling)
4. Modular package design with clear separation of concerns
5. Strict linting and code quality enforcement
6. Extensive documentation

The primary purpose of this tool is to be a pre-commit hook utility for other projects. It's not a production service with high reliability requirements or a large user base, but we do want to maintain good coding practices.

## Question
Looking at our TODO list and recent development work for Glance:

1. Are we overengineering this utility tool? How much is appropriate engineering for a CLI tool primarily used as a pre-commit hook?

2. Specifically regarding testing and mocking approaches:
   - Is our current approach with interface-based mocking excessive?
   - When is it appropriate to use interfaces versus function variables for mocking in a Go utility?
   - What level of test coverage is appropriate for a tool of this nature?

3. For future work in our TODO list:
   - Which items provide the most practical value given the tool's purpose?
   - Which items might be excessive or unnecessary for a CLI utility tool?
   - How should we prioritize remaining work for maximum benefit?
