# Task Plan: Create Build Workflow File

## Task ID and Title
**T017:** Create build workflow file

## Approach
I'll create a GitHub Actions workflow file (build.yml) that will verify the build process for the Glance project. This workflow will:

1. Trigger on appropriate events (push to main branch and pull requests)
2. Set up a matrix to build on multiple Go versions and operating systems
3. Configure the build process with proper flags and settings
4. Verify that the code builds successfully without errors
5. Store build artifacts for further analysis or deployment

## Implementation Plan

1. Create the file at `.github/workflows/build.yml`
2. Configure triggers to run on push to the main branch and pull requests
3. Set up a matrix strategy for multiple Go versions and operating systems:
   - Go: 1.23, 1.24
   - OS: Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
4. Define workflow steps:
   - Check out the code
   - Set up Go with specific version
   - Install dependencies
   - Build the project with optimization flags
   - Save the compiled binary as an artifact
5. Add proper timeout settings and error handling
6. Ensure the workflow follows GitHub Actions best practices

## Implementation Details

The build workflow will:
- Build on multiple platforms to ensure cross-platform compatibility
- Use optimized build flags for performance
- Save artifacts for later use or inspection
- Run on main branch pushes and pull requests
- Include appropriate conditionals to handle platform-specific behaviors
- Follow a similar pattern to the test and lint workflows for consistency
