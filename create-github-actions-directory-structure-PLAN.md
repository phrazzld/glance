# Task Plan: Create GitHub Actions Directory Structure

## Task ID and Title
**T014:** Create GitHub Actions directory structure

## Approach
Based on the repository inspection, it appears the `.github/workflows/` directory structure already exists with a `precommit.yml` file. I will:

1. Verify the existing structure is correct and follows GitHub Actions conventions
2. Document the current structure for reference
3. Update the TODO.md to show this task as completed since the structure exists

## Implementation Details

The standard GitHub Actions directory structure requires:
- A `.github` directory at the repository root
- A `workflows` subdirectory within `.github`
- YAML files within `workflows` that define specific CI/CD workflows

The existing structure appears to follow this pattern correctly with:
- `.github/` directory present 
- `.github/workflows/` subdirectory present
- At least one workflow file: `precommit.yml`

Given that this structure already exists, no new directory creation is needed, and we can mark this task as complete.
