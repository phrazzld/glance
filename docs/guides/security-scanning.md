## Overview

The Glance project implements mandatory vulnerability scanning to ensure that security vulnerabilities in dependencies are identified and addressed before code reaches production. This system provides:

- **Fail-fast security gates** that block builds containing HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- **Comprehensive reporting** with structured JSON output and GitHub Actions summaries
- **Emergency override capabilities** for critical production hotfixes
- **Full audit trails** with correlation ID tracking for compliance
- **Automated issue creation** for security debt tracking

### Key Components

- **govulncheck**: Go's official vulnerability scanner
- **GitHub Actions integration**: Automated scanning on every PR and push
- **Structured logging**: JSON logs with correlation IDs for observability
- **Emergency override system**: Controlled bypass mechanism for critical situations

## Security Policy

### Blocking Vulnerabilities

The system blocks builds when dependencies contain vulnerabilities of the following severities:

- **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Immediate build failure, no exceptions
- **üü† HIGH**: Immediate build failure, emergency override available
- **üü° MEDIUM**: Advisory only, build continues with warning
- **üü¢ LOW**: Advisory only, build continues with warning

### Policy Enforcement

1. **Automatic Enforcement**: All commits and pull requests are scanned
2. **No Bypass by Default**: HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities always block deployment
3. **Emergency Override**: Available for critical production hotfixes with approval
4. **Compliance Tracking**: All overrides logged and tracked with 48-hour remediation requirement

## Configuration

### Scan Configuration File

The vulnerability scanner is configured via `.govulncheck.yaml` in the project root:

```yaml
# Severity levels that cause build failure
fail_on_severity:
  - "HIGH"
  - "CRITICAL"

# Scan timeout in seconds
timeout_seconds: 300

# Scan level: module, package, or symbol
scan_level: "symbol"

# Output format for reports
output_format: "json"

# Retry attempts for network failures
retry_attempts: 2

# Reporting configuration
reporting:
  include_details: true
  include_remediation: true
  generate_correlation_id: true
```

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default | Options |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `fail_on_severity` | Vulnerability severities that block builds | `["HIGH", "CRITICAL"]` | `["CRITICAL", "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW"]` |
| `timeout_seconds` | Maximum scan duration | `300` | Any positive integer |
| `scan_level` | Depth of vulnerability analysis | `"symbol"` | `"module"`, `"package"`, `"symbol"` |
| `output_format` | Report format | `"json"` | `"json"`, `"text"` |
| `retry_attempts` | Network failure retry count | `2` | Any non-negative integer |

## Scan Behavior

### When Scans Run

Vulnerability scans are automatically triggered on:

- **Push to master branch** (excluding documentation changes)
- **Pull requests** targeting the master branch
- **Monthly dependency checks** (1st of each month at 01:00 UTC)

### Scan Process

1. **Configuration Loading**: Read settings from `.govulncheck.yaml`
2. **Correlation ID Generation**: Create unique identifier for traceability
3. **Vulnerability Database Update**: Fetch latest vulnerability data
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Scan all Go modules and dependencies
5. **Severity Assessment**: Classify findings by severity level
6. **Policy Enforcement**: Apply configured failure thresholds
7. **Report Generation**: Create structured JSON reports and GitHub summaries
8. **Artifact Upload**: Store reports for 30 days with correlation ID

### Scan Timing

- **Target Duration**: Under 60 seconds for typical projects
- **Timeout**: 300 seconds (configurable)
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs alongside linting and testing workflows

## Developer Workflow

### Normal Development Flow

1. **Develop and commit** code changes as usual
2. **Push to GitHub** or create pull request
3. **Automatic scan** runs in CI pipeline
4. **Review results** in GitHub Actions summary
5. **Address vulnerabilities** if any are found
6. **Re-commit and push** fixes

### When Vulnerabilities Are Found

#### üî¥ HIGH/CRITICAL Vulnerabilities

**Build Status**: ‚ùå BLOCKED

**Required Actions**:
1. Review vulnerability details in the GitHub Actions summary
2. Update affected dependencies to secure versions
3. Run `govulncheck ./...` locally to verify fixes
4. Commit and push updated dependencies

**Quick Fix Commands**:
```bash
# Update all dependencies
go get -u && go mod tidy

# Verify fixes
govulncheck ./...

# Commit updates
git add go.mod go.sum
git commit -m "fix: update dependencies to resolve security vulnerabilities"
```

#### üü° MEDIUM/LOW Vulnerabilities

**Build Status**: ‚úÖ CONTINUES (with advisory)

**Recommended Actions**:
- Consider updating affected dependencies when convenient
- Monitor for security advisories on these packages
- Plan updates during next maintenance window

### Local Development

#### Install govulncheck

```bash
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
```

#### Run Local Scans

```bash
# Quick scan
govulncheck ./...

# Detailed JSON output
govulncheck -format json ./... | jq

# Scan specific module
govulncheck ./path/to/module
```

#### Pre-commit Verification

```bash
# Run full pre-commit checks (includes vulnerability scan)
pre-commit run --all-files

# Or just vulnerability check
govulncheck ./...
```

## Emergency Override Procedures

### When to Use Emergency Override

Emergency override should **ONLY** be used for:

- **Critical production hotfixes** that cannot wait for dependency updates
- **Security patches** that must be deployed immediately
- **System outages** requiring immediate code deployment

### Override Process

#### 1. Security Team Approval

- Contact security team via designated channels
- Provide justification for emergency override
- Document business impact and risk assessment
- Obtain written approval with 48-hour remediation commitment

#### 2. Activate Override

Set the emergency override environment variable in the GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
env:
  EMERGENCY_SECURITY_OVERRIDE: true
```

Or configure it in repository secrets for reusable access.

#### 3. Deploy with Override

- Push commit with override activated
- Monitor build logs for override confirmation
- Verify automatic security debt issue creation

#### 4. Post-Override Requirements

**Immediate Actions** (within 1 hour):
- [ ] Document override justification in the auto-created GitHub issue
- [ ] Create remediation plan with specific timeline
- [ ] Assign security team member for tracking

**Within 48 Hours**:
- [ ] Update vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Run vulnerability scan to confirm resolution
- [ ] Deploy updated dependencies
- [ ] Close security debt issue
- [ ] Conduct post-incident review

### Override Audit Trail

Every override activation generates:

- **Structured logs** with correlation ID and user information
- **GitHub issue** with `security-debt` label for tracking
- **Audit timestamps** for compliance reporting
- **Remediation timeline** with automatic reminders

## Vulnerability Response

### Immediate Response (HIGH/CRITICAL)

1. **Assess Impact**: Review vulnerability details and affected components
2. **Check Exploitability**: Determine if vulnerability affects your usage
3. **Update Dependencies**: Use latest secure versions
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify functionality after updates
5. **Deploy Quickly**: Prioritize security fixes

### Dependency Update Strategies

#### Option 1: Targeted Updates

```bash
# Update specific vulnerable package
go get package/name@latest
go mod tidy

# Verify fix
govulncheck ./...
```

#### Option 2: Comprehensive Updates

```bash
# Update all dependencies
go get -u all
go mod tidy

# Run full test suite
go test -race ./...

# Verify security fixes
govulncheck ./...
```

#### Option 3: Pin to Secure Version

```bash
# Pin to specific secure version
go get package/name@v1.2.3
go mod tidy
```

### Communication During Response

- **Stakeholder Updates**: Inform relevant teams of security findings
- **Progress Tracking**: Use GitHub issue comments for status updates
- **Documentation**: Record decisions and rationale for future reference

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Scan Timeouts

**Symptoms**:
- Build fails with timeout error after 300 seconds
- "Vulnerability scan timed out" message in logs

**Solutions**:
- Increase `timeout_seconds` in `.govulncheck.yaml`
- Check network connectivity to vulnerability database
- Consider reducing `scan_level` from `symbol` to `package`

```yaml
# Increase timeout for large codebases
timeout_seconds: 600
```

#### 2. Network Connectivity Issues

**Symptoms**:
- "Failed to fetch vulnerability database" errors
- Intermittent scan failures

**Solutions**:
- Verify https://vuln.go.dev accessibility
- Increase `retry_attempts` in configuration
- Check GitHub Actions network policies

#### 3. False Positive Vulnerabilities

**Symptoms**:
- Vulnerabilities reported for unused code paths
- Theoretical vulnerabilities in dead code

**Solutions**:
- Use `symbol`-level scanning to reduce false positives
- Review actual code usage vs. vulnerability paths
- Consider dependency replacement if issue persists

#### 4. Configuration File Issues

**Symptoms**:
- "Configuration file not found" errors
- Invalid configuration format warnings

**Solutions**:
- Ensure `.govulncheck.yaml` exists in project root
- Validate YAML syntax with `yamllint`
- Check file permissions and encoding

#### 5. Emergency Override Not Working

**Symptoms**:
- Override variable set but build still fails
- Override not recognized in logs

**Solutions**:
- Verify exact variable name: `EMERGENCY_SECURITY_OVERRIDE`
- Ensure value is exactly `"true"` (case-sensitive)
- Check variable scope (repository vs. environment)

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Local debugging
GOVULNCHECK_DEBUG=1 govulncheck ./...

# CI debugging - add to workflow
- name: Debug vulnerability scan
  env:
    GOVULNCHECK_DEBUG: 1
    ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
  run: govulncheck -v ./...
```

### Log Analysis

#### Correlation ID Tracking

Every scan generates a correlation ID in the format: `vuln-scan-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-{git-sha}`

Use this ID to:
- Track related log entries across systems
- Reference specific scan instances
- Correlate with GitHub artifacts and issues

#### Structured Log Fields
