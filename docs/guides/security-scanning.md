## Overview

The Glance project implements mandatory vulnerability scanning to ensure that security vulnerabilities in dependencies are identified and addressed before code reaches production. This system provides:

- **Fail-fast security gates** that block builds containing HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- **Comprehensive reporting** with structured JSON output and GitHub Actions summaries
- **Emergency override capabilities** for critical production hotfixes
- **Full audit trails** with correlation ID tracking for compliance
- **Automated issue creation** for security debt tracking

### Key Components

- **govulncheck**: Go's official vulnerability scanner
- **GitHub Actions integration**: Automated scanning on every PR and push
- **Structured logging**: JSON logs with correlation IDs for observability
- **Emergency override system**: Controlled bypass mechanism for critical situations

## Security Policy

### Blocking Vulnerabilities

The system blocks builds when dependencies contain vulnerabilities of the following severities:

- **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Immediate build failure, no exceptions
- **üü† HIGH**: Immediate build failure, emergency override available
- **üü° MEDIUM**: Advisory only, build continues with warning
- **üü¢ LOW**: Advisory only, build continues with warning

### Policy Enforcement

1. **Automatic Enforcement**: All commits and pull requests are scanned
2. **No Bypass by Default**: HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities always block deployment
3. **Emergency Override**: Available for critical production hotfixes with approval
4. **Compliance Tracking**: All overrides logged and tracked with 48-hour remediation requirement

## Configuration

### Scan Configuration File

The vulnerability scanner is configured via `.govulncheck.yaml` in the project root:

```yaml
# Severity levels that cause build failure
fail_on_severity:
  - "HIGH"
  - "CRITICAL"

# Scan timeout in seconds
timeout_seconds: 300

# Scan level: module, package, or symbol
scan_level: "symbol"

# Output format for reports
output_format: "json"

# Retry attempts for network failures
retry_attempts: 2

# Reporting configuration
reporting:
  include_details: true
  include_remediation: true
  generate_correlation_id: true
```

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default | Options |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `fail_on_severity` | Vulnerability severities that block builds | `["HIGH", "CRITICAL"]` | `["CRITICAL", "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW"]` |
| `timeout_seconds` | Maximum scan duration | `300` | Any positive integer |
| `scan_level` | Depth of vulnerability analysis | `"symbol"` | `"module"`, `"package"`, `"symbol"` |
| `output_format` | Report format | `"json"` | `"json"`, `"text"` |
| `retry_attempts` | Network failure retry count | `2` | Any non-negative integer |

## Scan Behavior

### When Scans Run

Vulnerability scans are automatically triggered in the following scenarios:

#### Branch-Specific Scanning Behavior

**Master Branch:**
- ‚úÖ **Direct pushes** to master branch trigger full vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ **Scheduled scans** run monthly (1st of each month at 01:00 UTC)
- ‚ùå **Documentation-only changes** are excluded (see [excluded paths](#excluded-paths))

**Feature Branches:**
- ‚úÖ **Pull requests** targeting master branch trigger vulnerability scanning
- ‚ùå **Direct pushes** to feature branches do NOT trigger vulnerability scanning
- ‚ùå **Pull requests** targeting non-master branches do NOT trigger vulnerability scanning

**Release/Hotfix Branches:**
- ‚úÖ **Pull requests** to master trigger scanning (same as feature branches)
- ‚ùå **Direct pushes** to release branches do NOT trigger vulnerability scanning

#### Excluded Paths

The following changes do NOT trigger vulnerability scans (even on master):
- `**.md` - All Markdown documentation files
- `docs/**` - Documentation directory
- `LICENSE` - License file
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**` - GitHub issue templates
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - PR template

#### Manual Triggering

- **Workflow Dispatch**: Some workflows support manual triggering for testing
- **Emergency Scans**: Can be triggered manually during security incident response

### Scan Process

1. **Configuration Loading**: Read settings from `.govulncheck.yaml`
2. **Correlation ID Generation**: Create unique identifier for traceability
3. **Vulnerability Database Update**: Fetch latest vulnerability data
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Scan all Go modules and dependencies
5. **Severity Assessment**: Classify findings by severity level
6. **Policy Enforcement**: Apply configured failure thresholds
7. **Report Generation**: Create structured JSON reports and GitHub summaries
8. **Artifact Upload**: Store reports for 30 days with correlation ID

### Scan Timing

- **Target Duration**: Under 60 seconds for typical projects
- **Timeout**: 300 seconds (configurable)
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs alongside linting and testing workflows

### Branch Workflow Implications

Understanding when scans run is critical for effective development workflows:

#### Feature Branch Development

**‚úÖ Recommended Workflow:**
1. Create feature branch from master
2. Develop and commit changes on feature branch
3. **Create pull request** to master ‚Üí triggers vulnerability scan
4. Address any vulnerabilities found during PR review
5. Merge to master after scan passes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- Direct pushes to feature branches are NOT scanned
- Vulnerabilities may only be discovered when creating PR to master
- Consider running `govulncheck ./...` locally before creating PR

#### Hotfix/Release Workflow

**For urgent fixes:**
1. Create hotfix branch from master
2. Implement minimal fix
3. **Create PR to master** ‚Üí triggers vulnerability scan
4. If scan fails and fix is critical, use [emergency override](#emergency-override-procedures)
5. Merge after scan passes or override is approved

#### Dependency Updates

**When updating dependencies:**
- New vulnerabilities may be introduced even in patch updates
- Always create PR to master to trigger scanning before merge
- Consider running `govulncheck ./...` locally after `go get -u`

#### Development Best Practices

**Local Testing:**
```bash
# Run vulnerability scan locally before pushing
govulncheck ./...

# Check for dependency updates that might introduce vulnerabilities  
go get -u && go mod tidy && govulncheck ./...
```

**Branch Protection:**
- Master branch protection ensures all changes go through PR process
- This guarantees vulnerability scanning for all code reaching master
- Direct pushes to master bypass this protection (admin access only)

## Developer Workflow

### Normal Development Flow

1. **Develop and commit** code changes as usual
2. **Push to GitHub** or create pull request
3. **Automatic scan** runs in CI pipeline
4. **Review results** in GitHub Actions summary
5. **Address vulnerabilities** if any are found
6. **Re-commit and push** fixes

### When Vulnerabilities Are Found

#### üî¥ HIGH/CRITICAL Vulnerabilities

**Build Status**: ‚ùå BLOCKED

**Required Actions**:
1. Review vulnerability details in the GitHub Actions summary
2. Update affected dependencies to secure versions
3. Run `govulncheck ./...` locally to verify fixes
4. Commit and push updated dependencies

**Quick Fix Commands**:
```bash
# Update all dependencies
go get -u && go mod tidy

# Verify fixes
govulncheck ./...

# Commit updates
git add go.mod go.sum
git commit -m "fix: update dependencies to resolve security vulnerabilities"
```

#### üü° MEDIUM/LOW Vulnerabilities

**Build Status**: ‚úÖ CONTINUES (with advisory)

**Recommended Actions**:
- Consider updating affected dependencies when convenient
- Monitor for security advisories on these packages
- Plan updates during next maintenance window

### Dependabot Integration

**Overview**: This project uses GitHub Dependabot for automated dependency updates, which works in coordination with vulnerability scanning.

#### When Dependabot Creates PRs

**Dependabot Security Update PRs**:
- ‚úÖ **Automatically trigger** vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ **Usually pass** scanning (fixing known vulnerabilities)
- ‚úÖ **Should be reviewed and merged promptly**

**Dependabot Version Update PRs**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **May occasionally introduce** new vulnerabilities
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Will be blocked** if HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities detected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Require investigation** if scan fails

#### Coordinating Manual Fixes vs Dependabot

**Decision Matrix**:

| Situation | Recommended Action |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Vulnerability detected, no Dependabot PR | Wait 24-48 hours for Dependabot |
| Vulnerability detected, urgent fix needed | Create manual fix PR |
| Dependabot PR exists but fails scanning | Investigate and wait for new Dependabot PR |
| Multiple dependency PRs exist | Choose most comprehensive fix |

**Best Practices**:
- **Check for existing Dependabot PRs** before creating manual dependency updates
- **Merge Dependabot security PRs quickly** to reduce exposure time
- **Close redundant PRs** with clear explanation of choice
- **Document rationale** for manual fixes over Dependabot

#### Common Dependabot Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Dependabot Fixes Vulnerabilities**
```
‚úÖ Recommended Flow:
1. Dependabot creates PR with security fix
2. PR automatically triggers vulnerability scan  
3. Scan passes ‚Üí Review and merge immediately
4. Main branch security restored
```

**Scenario 2: Dependabot Update Introduces Vulnerabilities**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Investigation Required:
1. Dependabot creates PR with version update
2. PR triggers vulnerability scan
3. Scan fails ‚Üí Investigate vulnerability details
4. Options:
   - Wait for new Dependabot PR with safer version
   - Create manual fix with pinned secure version
   - Use emergency override if critically needed
```

**Scenario 3: Manual Fix vs Dependabot Race**
```
ü§ù Coordination Required:
1. Developer notices vulnerability
2. Starts working on manual fix
3. Dependabot creates PR during development
4. Choose one approach:
   - Use Dependabot PR if it's sufficient
   - Continue with manual PR if more comprehensive
   - Combine approaches if needed
```

**For complete Dependabot coordination workflows, see: [Dependabot Integration Guide](dependabot-integration.md)**

### Local Development

#### Install govulncheck

```bash
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
```

#### Run Local Scans

```bash
# Quick scan
govulncheck ./...

# Detailed JSON output
govulncheck -format json ./... | jq

# Scan specific module
govulncheck ./path/to/module
```

#### Pre-commit Verification

```bash
# Run full pre-commit checks (includes vulnerability scan)
pre-commit run --all-files

# Or just vulnerability check
govulncheck ./...
```

## Emergency Override Procedures

### When to Use Emergency Override

Emergency override should **ONLY** be used for:

- **Critical production hotfixes** that cannot wait for dependency updates
- **Security patches** that must be deployed immediately
- **System outages** requiring immediate code deployment

### Override Process

#### 1. Security Team Approval

- Contact security team via designated channels
- Provide justification for emergency override
- Document business impact and risk assessment
- Obtain written approval with 48-hour remediation commitment

#### 2. Activate Override

Set the emergency override environment variable in the GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
env:
  EMERGENCY_SECURITY_OVERRIDE: true
```

Or configure it in repository secrets for reusable access.

#### 3. Deploy with Override

- Push commit with override activated
- Monitor build logs for override confirmation
- Verify automatic security debt issue creation

#### 4. Post-Override Requirements

**Immediate Actions** (within 1 hour):
- [ ] Document override justification in the auto-created GitHub issue
- [ ] Create remediation plan with specific timeline
- [ ] Assign security team member for tracking

**Within 48 Hours**:
- [ ] Update vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Run vulnerability scan to confirm resolution
- [ ] Deploy updated dependencies
- [ ] Close security debt issue
- [ ] Conduct post-incident review

### Override Audit Trail

Every override activation generates:

- **Structured logs** with correlation ID and user information
- **GitHub issue** with `security-debt` label for tracking
- **Audit timestamps** for compliance reporting
- **Remediation timeline** with automatic reminders

## Vulnerability Response

### Immediate Response (HIGH/CRITICAL)

1. **Assess Impact**: Review vulnerability details and affected components
2. **Check Exploitability**: Determine if vulnerability affects your usage
3. **Update Dependencies**: Use latest secure versions
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify functionality after updates
5. **Deploy Quickly**: Prioritize security fixes

### Dependency Update Strategies

#### Option 1: Targeted Updates

```bash
# Update specific vulnerable package
go get package/name@latest
go mod tidy

# Verify fix
govulncheck ./...
```

#### Option 2: Comprehensive Updates

```bash
# Update all dependencies
go get -u all
go mod tidy

# Run full test suite
go test -race ./...

# Verify security fixes
govulncheck ./...
```

#### Option 3: Pin to Secure Version

```bash
# Pin to specific secure version
go get package/name@v1.2.3
go mod tidy
```

### Communication During Response

- **Stakeholder Updates**: Inform relevant teams of security findings
- **Progress Tracking**: Use GitHub issue comments for status updates
- **Documentation**: Record decisions and rationale for future reference

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Scan Timeouts

**Symptoms**:
- Build fails with timeout error after 300 seconds
- "Vulnerability scan timed out" message in logs

**Solutions**:
- Increase `timeout_seconds` in `.govulncheck.yaml`
- Check network connectivity to vulnerability database
- Consider reducing `scan_level` from `symbol` to `package`

```yaml
# Increase timeout for large codebases
timeout_seconds: 600
```

#### 2. Network Connectivity Issues

**Symptoms**:
- "Failed to fetch vulnerability database" errors
- Intermittent scan failures

**Solutions**:
- Verify https://vuln.go.dev accessibility
- Increase `retry_attempts` in configuration
- Check GitHub Actions network policies

#### 3. False Positive Vulnerabilities

**Symptoms**:
- Vulnerabilities reported for unused code paths
- Theoretical vulnerabilities in dead code

**Solutions**:
- Use `symbol`-level scanning to reduce false positives
- Review actual code usage vs. vulnerability paths
- Consider dependency replacement if issue persists

#### 4. Configuration File Issues

**Symptoms**:
- "Configuration file not found" errors
- Invalid configuration format warnings

**Solutions**:
- Ensure `.govulncheck.yaml` exists in project root
- Validate YAML syntax with `yamllint`
- Check file permissions and encoding

#### 5. Emergency Override Not Working

**Symptoms**:
- Override variable set but build still fails
- Override not recognized in logs

**Solutions**:
- Verify exact variable name: `EMERGENCY_SECURITY_OVERRIDE`
- Ensure value is exactly `"true"` (case-sensitive)
- Check variable scope (repository vs. environment)

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
# Local debugging
GOVULNCHECK_DEBUG=1 govulncheck ./...

# CI debugging - add to workflow
- name: Debug vulnerability scan
  env:
    GOVULNCHECK_DEBUG: 1
    ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
  run: govulncheck -v ./...
```

### Log Analysis

#### Correlation ID Tracking

Every scan generates a correlation ID in the format: `vuln-scan-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-{git-sha}`

Use this ID to:
- Track related log entries across systems
- Reference specific scan instances
- Correlate with GitHub artifacts and issues

#### Structured Log Fields

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "service_name": "vulnerability-scanner",
  "correlation_id": "vuln-scan-20240115-103045-a1b2c3d",

## Branch Scanning Behavior Validation

This section documents the testing and validation performed to verify branch-specific scanning behavior described in this guide.

### Testing Methodology

The branch scanning behavior was validated through systematic analysis of GitHub Actions workflow configurations and trigger patterns:

#### Workflow Configuration Analysis

**Files Analyzed:**
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` (contains vulnerability scanning)
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- `.github/workflows/vulnerability-scan-optimized.yml` (prototype)

**Trigger Pattern Findings:**
All production workflows use identical trigger configuration:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
    paths-ignore: ['**.md', 'docs/**', 'LICENSE', '.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**', '.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md']
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]
```

#### Validation Results

**‚úÖ Confirmed Behaviors:**

1. **Master Branch Scanning**
   - Direct pushes to master trigger all workflows including vulnerability scanning
   - Scheduled monthly scans run only for lint workflow (1st of month at 01:00 UTC)
   - Documentation changes are properly excluded via `paths-ignore`

2. **Feature Branch Scanning**
   - Pull requests targeting master correctly trigger vulnerability scanning
   - Direct pushes to feature branches do NOT trigger any CI workflows
   - Pull requests targeting non-master branches do NOT trigger workflows

3. **Path Exclusions**
   - Documentation files (`**.md`, `docs/**`) are excluded from triggers
   - Template files and LICENSE are excluded as expected
   - Code changes always trigger scanning regardless of branch (when PR targets master)

4. **Workflow Consistency**
   - All production workflows (lint, test, build) use identical branch triggers
   - Vulnerability scanning runs in parallel with other CI jobs
   - Concurrency controls prevent duplicate workflow runs

#### Branch Testing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Feature Branch Development**
- Current branch: `20-integrate-mandatory-vulnerability-scanning-govulncheck-into-ci`
- Behavior: Direct pushes do NOT trigger CI (as expected)
- PR to master: Would trigger vulnerability scanning (validated via config)

**Scenario 2: Documentation Changes**
- Changes to `docs/guides/security-scanning.md`
- Behavior: Excluded from CI triggers via `paths-ignore` (as expected)
- Exception: Still triggers if other non-excluded files are modified

**Scenario 3: Mixed Changes**
- Documentation + code changes in same commit
- Behavior: CI triggers run because code changes are present
- Scanning includes all files but triggered by non-excluded changes

### Validation Limitations

**Not Tested (Requires Live CI Environment):**
- Actual workflow execution timing
- Real vulnerability detection in different branch contexts
- Emergency override functionality across branch types
- Performance impact of scanning frequency

**Future Validation Recommended:**
- Live testing with intentional vulnerabilities on different branch types
- Monitoring of scan frequency and resource usage
- Validation of artifact generation and retention across branches

### Configuration Consistency Verification

All vulnerability scanning behavior is consistent across:
- ‚úÖ **lint.yml**: Primary vulnerability scanning workflow
- ‚úÖ **test.yml**: Testing workflow (same triggers)
- ‚úÖ **build.yml**: Build workflow (same triggers)  
- ‚úÖ **vulnerability-scan-optimized.yml**: Prototype with caching optimizations

This ensures that vulnerability scanning behavior matches the broader CI/CD pipeline trigger patterns, providing predictable and consistent security enforcement across all development workflows.
