# Mermaid Diagram Generator

## Purpose
Generate a precise, effective Mermaid diagram that clarifies system architecture, workflows, or relationships.

## Diagram Requirements

### Structure
- Use precise, descriptive node names/IDs
- Organize elements logically (left-to-right, top-to-bottom, chronological)
- Group related elements where appropriate
- Use colors meaningfully (not decoratively)
- Include title and legend if beneficial for comprehension

### Content
- Focus on key relationships/interactions (avoid excessive detail)
- Show clear interfaces/boundaries between components
- Label relationships/transitions precisely
- Express direction of data flow/dependency/sequence clearly
- Note the purpose/rationale for critical components

### Clarity
- Keep diagrams focused (limit to <20 elements when possible)
- Use consistent terminology matching codebase
- Include only essential details (5-7 word descriptions max)
- Avoid crossing lines when possible
- Use subgraphs to manage complexity

## Output Format
Provide your response as a markdown code block with the mermaid syntax, followed by a brief explanation of the diagram and its key insights.

## Diagram Types
- **flowchart**: directed graphs, system architecture
- **sequenceDiagram**: interaction sequences
- **classDiagram**: class relationships, system components
- **stateDiagram**: state machines, transitions
- **entityRelationshipDiagram**: data models
- **mindmap**: hierarchical concepts
