# T041 Plan: Create SECURITY_SUPPRESSIONS.md Document

## Task Description
- **T041 · chore · p2: create SECURITY_SUPPRESSIONS.md document**
- **Context:** CR-03: Address excessive `#nosec` suppressions
- **Action:**
  1. Create document explaining security decisions
  2. Include justification for any remaining suppressions
- **Done when:**
  1. Document exists with clear rationale for necessary suppressions

## Implementation Approach

1. First, identify all remaining `#nosec` annotations in the codebase after T040
2. For each annotation, document:
   - The specific rule being suppressed (e.g., G304, G306)
   - The location (file and function)
   - The justification for why the suppression is necessary
   - Any mitigations that have been put in place

3. Structure the document as follows:
   - Introduction explaining the purpose of the document
   - Security principles and approach
   - Table or list of remaining suppressions with justifications
   - Conclusion with guidelines for future suppressions

## Files to Create
- `/docs/SECURITY_SUPPRESSIONS.md`: New document explaining security decisions and suppressions
