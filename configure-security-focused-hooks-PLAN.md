# T009: Configure security-focused hooks

## Task Description
Add hooks to detect secrets, credentials, or other sensitive information in commits.

## Approach
1. Examine the current .pre-commit-config.yaml file, particularly the detect-secrets section
2. Configure the security-focused hooks:
   - detect-secrets: Configure with appropriate settings to find API keys, passwords, tokens
   - detect-private-key: Prevent private keys from being committed
   - no-commit-to-branch: Protect main/master branches from direct commits
   - check-aws-credentials: Prevent AWS credentials from being committed
   - Add other security hooks as needed
3. Add appropriate exclusions and configurations for each hook
4. Document the hooks with clear names and descriptions
5. Validate the configuration to ensure it's properly formed
