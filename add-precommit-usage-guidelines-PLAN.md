# Task Plan: Add Pre-commit Usage Guidelines to DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md

## Task ID and Title
**T013:** Add pre-commit usage guidelines to DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md

## Approach
I'll add a dedicated section to the DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md document explaining the importance of pre-commit hooks in maintaining code quality and enforcing standards. This section will align with the existing document structure and principles, particularly emphasizing the "Automate Everything" principle and "Maximize Language Strictness & Tooling Enforcement" standard.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a new section focused on pre-commit hooks as part of the quality assurance process
2. Explain why pre-commit hooks are mandatory in our workflow
3. Provide guidelines on:
   - When and how hooks are applied
   - How to handle hook failures
   - The importance of not bypassing hooks
   - How pre-commit checks connect to CI/CD pipelines
4. Emphasize consistency between local development and CI environments
5. Show how pre-commit hooks support our core principles of automation and quality

This section will be placed in a logical location within the document, likely under "Coding Standards" as a new subsection focused specifically on pre-commit workflow.
