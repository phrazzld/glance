# T006: Configure Go-specific test hooks

## Task Description
Add go-test hook to run unit tests during the pre-commit phase.

## Approach
1. Examine the current .pre-commit-config.yaml file
2. Add or configure the go-unit-tests hook in the Go-specific hooks section
3. Configure additional test-related hooks:
   - go-mod-tidy: Ensures go.mod is tidy before running tests
   - go-build: Ensures code compiles without errors
4. Set appropriate options for each hook:
   - Proper command arguments (verbose, race detection)
   - File pattern matching to only run when Go files change
   - Optimizations for test performance
5. Document the changes with comments in the YAML file
6. Validate the configuration to ensure it's properly formed
