3. **Document Each Workflow**
   - For each workflow file, document:
     - Purpose and scope
     - Trigger configuration
     - Environment setup
     - Steps and actions
     - What constitutes success vs. failure
     - Output artifacts and reports

4. **Include Real Examples**
   - Reference results from the test pull request (T020)
   - Include example output snippets
   - Explain how to interpret workflow results

5. **Add Cross-References**
   - Add references to the GitHub Actions documentation in other documents like README.md
   - Ensure consistency with existing documentation

6. **Commit Changes**
