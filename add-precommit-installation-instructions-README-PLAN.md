# Task Plan: Add Pre-commit Installation Instructions to README.md

## Task ID and Title
**T012:** Add pre-commit installation instructions to README.md

## Approach
The existing README.md already has a basic section on pre-commit hooks, but it needs more detailed instructions to ensure developers can easily set up and use the hooks. I'll enhance this section with:

1. More comprehensive installation instructions
2. Clear explanation of what pre-commit hooks do and why they're important
3. Brief overview of the specific hooks used in the project
4. Common troubleshooting tips

## Implementation Plan

1. Review current README.md section on pre-commit hooks (lines 75-93)
2. Review existing docs/PRECOMMIT.md for detailed information 
3. Enhance the README.md section with:
   - More comprehensive installation instructions for different platforms
   - Explanation of available hooks and what they do
   - Information on how to run hooks manually
   - Links to more detailed documentation
4. Maintain a clean, concise format consistent with the rest of the README
5. Update the section while ensuring it complements rather than duplicates the detailed docs/PRECOMMIT.md
