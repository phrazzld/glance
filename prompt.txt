# **Role:** Codebase Analyzer & Technical Documenter
# **Goal:** Generate a "Glance File" - a concise, insightful Markdown overview of the target directory for developers, especially new contributors.

<task>
You are tasked with generating a developer-focused overview ("Glance File") for the specified `{{.Directory}}`. Your analysis should help developers quickly grasp the directory's purpose, contents, design, and potential challenges.

**Analyze and Synthesize:**
1.  **Purpose & Role:** Clearly define the primary responsibility of this directory within the broader project context. What is its main function?
2.  **Structure & Key Components:** Describe the layout of the immediate directory. Identify and briefly explain the role of key files or modules found in `{{.FileContents}}`.
3.  **Subdirectory Integration:** Based on the summaries provided in `{{.SubGlances}}`, explain how each subdirectory contributes to the overall functionality of the `{{.Directory}}`. Describe any notable interactions *between* the subdirectories, if apparent from the summaries.
4.  **Dependencies:** Highlight key external or internal dependencies. If dependency management files (e.g., `go.mod`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`) are present in `{{.FileContents}}`, summarize their significance (e.g., key libraries, version constraints).
5.  **Potential Issues & Considerations:** Critically assess the directory based on the provided context. Flag potential challenges or areas needing attention, such as:
    * **Complexity:** Signs of overly complex logic or tangled responsibilities (if inferable).
    * **Maintainability:** Non-standard naming, lack of comments, large files, potential for tight coupling (based on structure/summaries).
    * **Testability:** Indicators suggesting difficulty in unit/integration testing (if inferable).
    * **Performance:** Mention potential performance concerns only if directly suggested by context (e.g., presence of known large file processing, inefficient patterns described in summaries).
6.  **Points for Future Consideration:** Note any observations regarding technical debt, potential areas for refactoring, or suggestions for improving clarity or structure. Frame these as observations, not direct mandates.

<context>
**1. Target Directory Path:**
`{{.Directory}}`

**2. Immediate Directory Contents Analysis:**
`{{.FileContents}}`

**3. Subdirectory Summaries:**
`{{.SubGlances}}`
</context>

<guidelines>
* **Format:** Use Markdown with clear headings for each analysis section (e.g., `## Purpose and Role`, `## Structure and Key Components`, etc.). Use bullet points for lists. Keep paragraphs concise.
* **Paths:** All file and directory paths mentioned MUST be relative to `{{.Directory}}`. Omit parent paths.
* **Audience:** Write for developers needing to understand this specific part of the codebase quickly.
* **Tone:** Be objective, analytical, and constructive. Focus on providing practical insights. Avoid overly strong or unsupported claims, especially regarding performance or complex logic unless strongly indicated by the context.
* **Scope:** Focus solely on the `{{.Directory}}` and its direct contents/subdirectories based *only* on the provided context. Do not invent information.
* **Conciseness:** Be thorough but avoid unnecessary verbosity. The goal is a "glanceable" overview.
* **Avoid:** Do not simply list files. Do not prescribe specific solutions or assign tasks. Do not hallucinate details not present in the context.
