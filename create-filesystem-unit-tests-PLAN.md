# Create Filesystem Unit Tests

## Goal
Enhance test coverage for the filesystem package by adding comprehensive unit tests for all functions, focusing on edge cases, error handling, and integration between components.

## Implementation Approach
I will implement a comprehensive testing strategy for the filesystem package that includes:

1. **Expanding existing test coverage**:
   - The filesystem package already has basic test coverage for many functions, but we need to enhance it with more edge cases and error conditions.
   - Focus on achieving higher coverage by testing error paths, boundary conditions, and interactions between components.

2. **Using testify mocks and test fixtures**:
   - Create reusable test fixtures and helper functions to set up consistent test environments.
   - Utilize mock implementations where needed to isolate tests from external dependencies.
   - Leverage the existing mock utility pattern in mock_test.go for file system operations that might be hard to test directly.

3. **Simulating filesystem conditions**:
   - Create temporary test directories with controlled file structures.
   - Simulate various gitignore patterns and directory hierarchies.
   - Set up test cases for binary vs. text files, large files, and special characters in filenames.

## Key Testing Areas

1. **Scanner functionality**:
   - Test how the scanner handles deeply nested directories
   - Test behavior with multiple .gitignore files at different levels
   - Test error handling during directory traversal
   - Test special cases like symlinks and unusual permissions

2. **Reader functionality**:
   - Enhance tests for binary vs. text file detection
   - Test handling of very large files and truncation
   - Test handling of files with various encodings and character sets
   - Test error conditions like permission denied or I/O errors

3. **Ignore logic**:
   - Test complex gitignore patterns and combinations
   - Test precedence rules when multiple patterns apply
   - Test handling of special gitignore syntax like negation (!)
   - Test performance with large numbers of patterns

4. **Utility functions**:
   - Test boundary conditions for modification time comparisons
   - Test regeneration logic with various file modification scenarios
   - Test path handling with different operating system path separators
   - Test error handling in utility functions

## Reasoning
This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Comprehensive coverage**: By systematically testing all functions with diverse inputs and conditions, we ensure the filesystem package behaves correctly across a wide range of scenarios.

2. **Controlled testing environment**: Using temporary directories and mock objects allows for deterministic testing without affecting the real filesystem.

3. **Reusable test infrastructure**: Creating helper functions and fixtures makes it easier to write and maintain tests, as well as extend test coverage in the future.

4. **Isolation**: Testing components in isolation first and then their interactions ensures that issues can be pinpointed accurately when tests fail.

This approach aligns with Go's testing philosophy and the existing project structure, while providing a solid foundation for ongoing development and maintenance.
