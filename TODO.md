2. **Team Adoption**: Development team will adopt new security workflows with proper documentation
3. **Integration Stability**: govulncheck tool API remains stable for CI integration
4. **Network Reliability**: CI environment has sufficient network reliability for vulnerability database access

### Risk Mitigations
1. **False Positive Risk**: Emergency override mechanism with audit trail and 48-hour remediation window
2. **Performance Impact**: Parallel execution and caching strategy investigation
3. **Network Dependency**: Retry logic and graceful degradation for network failures
4. **Tool Availability**: Pin specific govulncheck version to ensure consistency
