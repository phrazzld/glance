# Expected GitHub Actions Workflow Results

This document outlines the expected results when the GitHub Actions workflows process these test files.

## Lint Workflow (`lint.yml`)

- **Expected actions:**
  - Should run `golangci-lint` on the Go files
  - Should detect the unused variable in `lint_test.go`
  - Should detect the inefficient string concatenation in `lint_test.go`
  - Should detect the extra spacing issue (formatting issue) in `lint_test.go`

## Pre-commit Workflow (`precommit.yml`)

- **Expected actions:**
  - Should run the pre-commit hooks on all files
  - Should detect and fail due to trailing whitespace in `trailing_whitespace.txt`
  - Should detect Go formatting issues in `lint_test.go`

## Test Workflow (`test.yml`)

- **Expected actions:**
  - Should run all Go tests
  - Should fail when running `failing_test.go` since it contains a deliberate assertion failure
  - Should report syntax errors in `compilation_error_test.go`

## Build Workflow (`build.yml`)

- **Expected actions:**
  - Should attempt to build the Go binary
  - May generate warnings from the `build_warning.go` file
  - Should detect compilation errors in `compilation_error_test.go`

## Path Ignore Testing

- **Expected actions:**
  - The `README.md` update alone should not trigger most workflows due to path-ignore rules
  - When combined with other changes, workflows should still run but ignore the README change

## Documentation

The results of these tests should be used to verify that:
1. The GitHub Actions workflows are correctly configured
2. All expected checks are running properly
3. The workflow triggers are working as expected
4. The appropriate error messages are being generated for each issue
