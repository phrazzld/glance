# Next Steps for GitHub Actions Testing

To complete the testing of GitHub Actions workflows, follow these steps:

## 1. Push Changes to GitHub

```bash
git push origin add-precommit-and-github-actions
```

## 2. Create a Pull Request

- Go to the GitHub repository
- Click "Pull requests" -> "New pull request"
- Select `add-precommit-and-github-actions` as the compare branch and `master` as the base branch
- Use the title: "Test GitHub Actions workflows with problematic code"
- Add a description that explains this is a test PR for verifying GitHub Actions workflows

Suggested description:
```
This is a test pull request to verify that the GitHub Actions workflows are correctly configured and functioning.

## Purpose
This PR contains deliberately problematic code to trigger various checks:
- Linting issues
- Formatting problems
- Failing tests
- Compilation errors
- Code with warnings

## Expected Outcome
The GitHub Actions workflows should detect these issues and mark the PR checks as failing.
This is a test PR and is not intended to be merged.
```

## 3. Verify Workflow Results

After creating the PR, monitor the GitHub Actions workflows:

1. Verify all workflows are triggered correctly
2. Check that each workflow detects the issues in the test files
3. Compare the actual results with the expected results in `EXPECTED_RESULTS.md`
4. Take screenshots or notes on the results for documentation

## 4. Create Documentation

Once the testing is complete, create documentation on the workflow results:

1. Create a file in `docs/` that documents:
   - The workflow configurations
   - What they check for
   - How they respond to different types of issues
   - Any limitations or considerations

2. Include examples of actual workflow runs from this test

## 5. Clean Up

After completing the testing and documentation:

1. Close the PR without merging
2. Record the PR number for future reference
3. Consider whether to keep or remove the test files

## Important Note

This PR is intentionally designed to fail the checks. A successful test in this case means that the workflows correctly identify and report the problems in the code.
