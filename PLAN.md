# Implementation Plan: Add Precommit Hooks and GitHub Actions

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to implement precommit hooks and GitHub Actions for the Glance project. The goal is to automate code quality checks, enforce formatting standards, run tests, and ensure consistent code quality across all contributions.

## Implementation Approach

We'll implement this in two main phases:
1. Set up local precommit hooks using the pre-commit framework
2. Configure GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD

## Detailed Steps

### Phase 1: Set up Local Precommit Hooks

1. **Install and configure pre-commit framework**
   - Add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to project root
   - Configure Go-specific hooks:
     - `go-fmt` - Enforce Go formatting standards
     - `go-vet` - Detect suspicious code
     - `golangci-lint` - Run comprehensive linting
     - `go-test` - Run unit tests
   - Add general hooks:
     - File formatting (trailing whitespace, end-of-file newlines)
     - Check for large files
     - Detect secrets/credentials

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Add precommit hook setup instructions to README.md
   - Add section to DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md about the importance of hooks

3. **Test Precommit Configuration**
   - Verify hooks run correctly on different operating systems
   - Ensure hooks catch common issues

### Phase 2: Configure GitHub Actions

1. **Set up GitHub Actions Workflow Files**
   - Create `.github/workflows/` directory
   - Add workflow definitions:
     - `test.yml` - Run tests on multiple Go versions
     - `lint.yml` - Run linting tools
     - `build.yml` - Verify build process

2. **Configure Workflow Triggers**
   - Run on push to main branch
   - Run on pull requests
   - Optional: periodic runs on schedule

3. **Add Status Badges**
   - Add workflow status badges to README.md
   - Display build, test, and linting status

4. **Test GitHub Actions Configuration**
   - Create test PR to verify workflows run correctly
   - Fix any issues found during testing

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:
1. Local precommit hooks enforce code standards before commits
2. GitHub Actions automatically verify all PRs and changes to main branch
3. Documentation is updated to explain both systems
4. Developers can easily set up the precommit environment

## Alignment with Development Philosophy

This implementation strongly aligns with the project's development principles:

- **Simplicity First**: Uses standard tools with minimal custom configuration. Relies on well-established patterns.
- **Automate Everything**: Directly implements the principle "Automate every feasible repetitive task." Will eliminate manual checking.
- **Coding Standards**: Provides tooling enforcement for the "Maximize Language Strictness & Tooling Enforcement" standard.
- **Modularity**: The hooks and GitHub Actions are cleanly separated, with each focused on specific responsibilities.
- **Testability**: Improves overall project testability by enforcing test running on every change.

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Overly strict rules may slow down development
   **Mitigation**: Start with essential rules and add more based on feedback

2. **Risk**: False positives from linting tools
   **Mitigation**: Carefully configure linting rules; allow specific justified exceptions

3. **Risk**: Performance impacts for local development
   **Mitigation**: Optimize hook configurations to only run necessary checks

## Conclusion

This plan provides a straightforward approach to implementing precommit hooks and GitHub Actions for the Glance project. It emphasizes automation, code quality, and developer experience, while aligning with the project's development philosophy.
