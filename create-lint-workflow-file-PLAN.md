# Task Plan: Create Lint Workflow File

## Task ID and Title
**T016:** Create lint workflow file

## Approach
I'll create a GitHub Actions workflow file (lint.yml) that will run linting tools on the codebase. This workflow will:

1. Run on appropriate triggers (push to main branch and pull requests)
2. Configure the necessary environment with Go and linting tools
3. Execute golangci-lint with appropriate configuration
4. Report findings in a structured way

## Implementation Plan

1. Create the file at `.github/workflows/lint.yml`
2. Configure it to run on push to the main branch and pull requests
3. Define steps for the workflow:
   - Check out the code
   - Set up Go with the latest version
   - Install and configure golangci-lint
   - Run golangci-lint with the project's configuration
   - Handle outputs and annotations for findings
4. Set appropriate timeout values and error handling
5. Ensure the workflow follows GitHub Actions best practices for linting

## Implementation Details

The lint workflow will:
- Use a fixed Go version for consistent linting results
- Use the project's existing `.golangci.yml` configuration
- Run linting in parallel where possible for better performance
- Set appropriate annotations for findings in PRs
- Skip certain files/patterns that are not relevant for linting
- Format output for better readability in GitHub's UI
