# Task Plan: Add Status Badges to README.md

## Task ID and Title
**T019:** Add status badges to README.md

## Approach
I'll add GitHub Actions workflow status badges to the README.md file to display the status of the build, test, and linting workflows. These badges will:

1. Provide immediate visual feedback on the health of the codebase
2. Link directly to the relevant GitHub Actions workflow results
3. Update automatically when workflow statuses change
4. Follow GitHub's recommended badge formatting

## Implementation Plan

1. Identify the appropriate location in the README.md to add badges (typically near the top)
2. Create badges for all four workflows:
   - Pre-commit Checks
   - Go Tests
   - Go Linting
   - Go Build
3. Use GitHub's standard badge syntax with appropriate icons and colors
4. Include links to the actual workflow results
5. Format the badges in a visually appealing way
6. Ensure the badges reflect the status of the master branch

## Implementation Details

The badges will be added near the top of the README.md file right after the project description to maximize visibility. Each badge will follow GitHub's recommended format:

```markdown
![Workflow Name](https://github.com/username/repo-name/workflows/workflow-name/badge.svg)
```

For Glance, the specific badge URLs will point to the repository's GitHub Actions workflows with proper URL encoding.
