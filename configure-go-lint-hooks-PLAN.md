# T005: Configure Go-specific linting hooks

## Task Description
Add golangci-lint hook with appropriate configuration based on project needs.

## Approach
1. Review the existing .golangci.yml file to understand current linting configurations
2. Add the golangci-lint hook to the .pre-commit-config.yaml file
3. Configure the hook to:
   - Use the existing .golangci.yml configuration file
   - Set appropriate options for pre-commit integration
   - Set a reasonable timeout for linting operations
   - Use verbose output for better debugging
4. Ensure both configuration files work together correctly
5. Validate the changes to ensure proper operation
