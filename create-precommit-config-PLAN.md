# T002: Create initial .pre-commit-config.yaml file

## Task Description
Create a .pre-commit-config.yaml file in the project root with basic configuration structure.

## Approach
1. Use the template from research-precommit.md as a starting point
2. Create a minimal initial configuration focused on the structure, not the specific hooks
3. Include the following sections:
   - Standard file formatting hooks repository
   - Go-specific hooks repository
   - Security-focused hooks repository
4. Set up only the basic framework with placeholder configurations
5. Ensure the file is properly formatted for YAML
