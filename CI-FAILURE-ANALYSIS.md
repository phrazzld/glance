# CI Failure Analysis

## Summary

The GitHub Actions workflow "Go Linting" is failing for the PR on the `add-precommit-and-github-actions` branch. The failure occurs in the `golangci-lint-action@v4` step with the error: `Error: unknown flag: --out-format`.

## Detailed Analysis

### Workflow Status

| Workflow | Status | Duration |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Pre-commit Checks | In Progress | 1m2s |
| Go Linting | Failed | 28s |
| Go Build | Success | 28s |
| Go Tests | Success | 55s |

### Failure Details

The `golangci-lint-action@v4` step in the "Go Linting" workflow is failing with the following error:

```
Error: unknown flag: --out-format
Failed executing command with error: unknown flag: --out-format
```

This is happening because the GitHub Action is attempting to use the flag `--out-format=github-actions`, but this flag is not recognized by golangci-lint v2.1.2, which is the version we've standardized on in our previous tasks.

### Root Cause

The issue is a version compatibility problem between the GitHub Action version and the golangci-lint version:

1. We're using `golangci-lint-action@v4` which is not fully compatible with golangci-lint v2.x
2. According to the official documentation, we should be using `golangci-lint-action@v7` for proper compatibility with golangci-lint v2.x
3. The action is automatically adding flags that aren't recognized by our version of golangci-lint

The command being executed is:

```bash
/home/runner/golangci-lint-2.1.2-linux-amd64/golangci-lint run --out-format=github-actions --config=.golangci.yml --timeout=2m --verbose
```

### Recommended Solution

Update the GitHub Action to use the latest version that's properly compatible with golangci-lint v2.x:

1. Change `golangci/golangci-lint-action@v4` to `golangci/golangci-lint-action@v7`
2. Simplify the arguments we pass to avoid conflicts with the action's built-in behavior
3. Make sure we're still using our standardized v2.1.2 version

## Implementation Plan

1. Update the workflow file `.github/workflows/lint.yml` to use the correct action version:

```yaml
- name: Install and run golangci-lint
  uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v7
  with:
    version: v2.1.2
    args: --timeout=2m --verbose
```

2. Let the action handle the configuration path and output format automatically, as it has built-in handling for golangci-lint v2.x compatibility.

## Additional Notes

- The cache service also reported a warning: `Failed to restore: Cache service responded with 422`, but this is not related to the main failure and is likely just because this is a new workflow or cache key.
- All other workflows (Go Build and Go Tests) are passing successfully, indicating that our code changes themselves are not causing issues.
