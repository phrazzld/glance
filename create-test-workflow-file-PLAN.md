# Task Plan: Create Test Workflow File

## Task ID and Title
**T015:** Create test workflow file

## Approach
I'll create a GitHub Actions workflow file (test.yml) that will run Go tests on multiple Go versions. This workflow will:

1. Trigger on relevant events (push to main branch and pull requests)
2. Set up a matrix to test across multiple Go versions (1.23, 1.24)
3. Configure necessary environment variables
4. Implement steps for:
   - Checking out the code
   - Setting up Go with the appropriate version
   - Caching dependencies
   - Running tests with proper flags

## Implementation Plan

1. Create the file at `.github/workflows/test.yml`
2. Configure the workflow to run on push to the main branch and pull requests
3. Set up a matrix strategy for testing on different Go versions
4. Define steps for the workflow:
   - Checkout code (using actions/checkout)
   - Set up Go (using actions/setup-go)
   - Cache dependencies
   - Run tests with appropriate flags (including race detection)
5. Add timeout and proper error handling
6. Ensure the workflow follows best practices for GitHub Actions
