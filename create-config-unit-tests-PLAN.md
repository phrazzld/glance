# Create Config Unit Tests

## Goal
Add comprehensive tests for the config package to verify correct loading of settings from various sources, including command-line arguments, environment variables, and files. These tests will ensure that configuration values are properly initialized, validated, and managed throughout the application lifecycle.

## Implementation Approach

After analyzing the existing config package code and existing tests, I'll enhance the test coverage with the following approach:

1. **Test Coverage Enhancements:**
   - Expand testing of `loadconfig.go` to cover more edge cases and scenarios
   - Add more comprehensive tests for environment variable loading
   - Add tests for the interaction between different configuration sources
   - Test error handling for various configuration scenarios

2. **Testing Areas:**
   - **Command-line Flag Parsing**: Test proper parsing of all supported flags
   - **Environment Variable Loading**: Test .env file loading and fallback to system environment variables
   - **Prompt Template Loading**: Test all three possible paths (explicit path, prompt.txt in working directory, default template)
   - **Path Validation**: Test directory checking functionality
   - **Error Cases**: Test all expected error conditions with proper error messages
   - **Config Building**: Test the proper application of the builder pattern

3. **Testing Approach:**
   - Use mocking for filesystem operations to avoid actual file creation/deletion
   - Create temporary files when necessary for testing file loading
   - Mock environment variables to test different configuration scenarios
   - Test the interaction between different configuration sources (command line, environment, files)

## Why This Approach

I've chosen this approach for the following reasons:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The strategy ensures we test all components of the config package, including flag parsing, environment variable loading, and file operations.

2. **Isolation**: By using mocks for filesystem operations and environment variables, we can test the config package in isolation without affecting the actual system state.

3. **Maintainability**: The tests will be structured in a way that makes them easy to understand and maintain, with clear setup and teardown steps.

4. **Robustness**: By testing various edge cases and failure scenarios, we ensure the config package is robust and handles errors appropriately.

The existing test structure is already well-designed with good separation of concerns. My approach builds on this foundation by expanding the test coverage and adding more comprehensive test cases while maintaining the existing test patterns.
