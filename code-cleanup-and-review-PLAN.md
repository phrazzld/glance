# Code Cleanup and Review

## Goal
Review naming, comments, constants, and formatting throughout the codebase using gofmt and golint to ensure code quality, consistency, and adherence to Go best practices.

## Implementation Approach
I'll implement a systematic approach to code cleanup and review, focusing on the following areas:

1. **Automated Formatting and Linting**:
   - Run `gofmt` to automatically format all Go code
   - Run `golint` to identify style issues and fix them
   - Run `go vet` to find potential bugs and issues

2. **Manual Code Review**:
   - Review package structure and organization
   - Check naming consistency (variables, functions, types)
   - Verify consistent commenting (packages, exported functions/types)
   - Review error handling patterns
   - Examine constants and magic numbers
   - Ensure consistent code style across packages

3. **Documentation Enhancement**:
   - Add missing documentation to exported functions
   - Ensure package documentation exists and is accurate
   - Verify examples are correct and helpful

4. **File-by-File Review**:
   - Review each file systematically, starting with core packages
   - Focus on readability and maintainability
   - Apply consistent patterns throughout the codebase

## Key Reasoning

I've chosen this approach for the following reasons:

1. **Combines Automated and Manual Review**: Using automated tools like `gofmt` and `golint` provides a solid foundation, while manual review addresses more subtle issues that tools can't catch.

2. **Systematic and Thorough**: By examining each file and focusing on specific aspects (naming, comments, error handling), we ensure no issues are missed.

3. **Focuses on Maintainability**: Clean code with consistent patterns and good documentation is easier to maintain and extend.

4. **Aligns with Go Best Practices**: Following Go conventions makes the code more accessible to Go developers and leverages community standards.

This approach will result in a more consistent, maintainable, and high-quality codebase that adheres to Go best practices and standards.
