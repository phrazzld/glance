- do NOT speculate about behavior, configuration, environment variables, dependencies, or architecture details not evidenced by the provided source snippets.
- do NOT provide recommendations, next steps, or hypothetical refactors.
- if a claim cannot be verified from the provided source snippets, omit it rather than infer.
- do NOT mention files or directories that are not listed in the provided input.

Output format:
## Purpose
One short paragraph (max 5 sentences) describing the directory-level intent.

## Key Roles
- list major files and their responsibilities
- if no obvious key roles are found, state "No dominant file roles detected."

## Dependencies and Caveats

- max 8 bullets
