# T008: Configure file size limitation hooks

## Task Description
Add hooks to check for excessively large files as per project standards.

## Approach
1. Examine the current .pre-commit-config.yaml file
2. Check the README.md for any file size limits mentioned
3. Configure the check-added-large-files hook in the pre-commit-hooks section:
   - Set appropriate maximum file size limit (default is usually 500KB)
   - Consider file type exclusions if needed
   - Add proper documentation in the configuration
4. Add check-case-conflict hook to prevent case sensitivity issues with filenames
5. Document the changes with comments in the YAML file
6. Validate the configuration to ensure it's properly formed
