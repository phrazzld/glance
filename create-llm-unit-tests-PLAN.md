# Create LLM Unit Tests

## Goal
Add comprehensive tests for the LLM package with a focus on verifying the functionality of the client, prompt generation, and service components. The aim is to ensure that the package correctly handles prompt generation, API interactions through mocked clients, and error cases including retry logic.

## Implementation Approach

After analyzing the current code and tests, I'll enhance the test coverage with the following approach:

1. **Client Testing**:
   - Enhance `client_test.go` to thoroughly test:
     - The GeminiClient implementation with mocked dependencies
     - Error handling in Generate and CountTokens methods
     - Retry logic with simulated failures
     - Edge cases like uninitialized clients, empty prompts, and timeout handling

2. **Prompt Testing**:
   - Enhance `prompt_test.go` to test:
     - Template loading from various sources (files, default template)
     - Error handling in template processing
     - Edge cases in prompt data (empty maps, special characters)
     - File content formatting with varied input formats

3. **Service Testing**:
   - Enhance `service_test.go` to test:
     - The complete workflow from prompt creation to API calling
     - Error propagation from client to service
     - Options configuration and functional options pattern
     - Verbose mode behavior and logging

## Testing Strategy

1. **Mock-based Testing**: Use mock objects to simulate API behavior, allowing controlled testing of success and failure cases without external dependencies.

2. **Integration Testing**: Add integration test stubs (disabled by default) to verify real API interaction when needed.

3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Test unusual inputs, error conditions, and edge cases to ensure robust handling.

4. **Test Helper Functions**: Create helper functions where needed to reduce code duplication in tests.

## Why This Approach

I've chosen this approach because:

1. **Focused on Full Coverage**: The strategy ensures we test all components of the LLM package, including client, prompt generation, and service layers.

2. **Isolation**: By using mocks, we can isolate tests from external dependencies (like the actual Gemini API), making tests reliable and fast.

3. **Maintainability**: The structure aligns with the existing test organization, making it easier to maintain and extend.

4. **Practical**: The approach emphasizes testing real-world usage patterns and error conditions, ensuring that the package handles expected scenarios correctly.
