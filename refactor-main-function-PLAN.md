# Refactor Main Function

## Goal
Shorten main.go by delegating setup, scanning, processing, and reporting to dedicated functions to improve readability, maintainability, and prepare for further modularization.

## Implementation Approach
1. Create smaller, purpose-specific functions in main.go that handle discrete responsibilities:
   - `setupLogging()` - Configure the logger based on verbose flag
   - `scanDirectories(config *config.Config)` - Handle directory traversal and identification
   - `processDirectory(dir string, config *config.Config)` - Handle GLANCE.md generation for a single directory
   - `generateMarkdown(dir string, files []string, config *config.Config)` - Generate content for a GLANCE.md file

2. Update the main() function to:
   - Use the new config.LoadConfig() function for configuration
   - Call these dedicated functions in sequence
   - Keep only high-level flow control and error handling in main()

## Reasoning
I considered three approaches:

1. **Simple extraction of functions**: Extract code blocks from main into functions but keep them in main.go
   - Pros: Simple, minimal changes required
   - Cons: Doesn't fully prepare for future package creation

2. **Complete package creation**: Move functionality entirely into new packages (filesystem, llm, ui)
   - Pros: Comprehensive, aligned with end goal
   - Cons: Too large a step for this single task, would need multiple packages at once

3. **Intermediate approach (chosen)**: Extract functions within main.go but design them with future package migration in mind
   - Pros: Improves code organization immediately while setting up for later tasks
   - Cons: Will require additional refactoring in future tasks

I've chosen the intermediate approach because:
- It delivers immediate improvements to readability
- It allows us to break the work into manageable chunks
- It provides a clearer path for the subsequent tasks that create dedicated packages
- It follows the incremental refactoring approach outlined in the plan
