# Pre-commit Hook Testing Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of testing the pre-commit hooks configured in the Glance project. Each hook was tested with specifically crafted test files designed to trigger the hook's functionality.

## Testing Environment

- **Date:** April 18, 2025
- **Project:** Glance
- **Test Framework:** Custom test script (`run_tests.sh`)
- **Test Files:** Located in `precommit-tests/` directory

## Testing Process

1. Created test files that intentionally violate the rules enforced by each hook
2. Ran each hook against its corresponding test file
3. Documented the hook's behavior and whether it correctly identified the issue

## Results Summary

| Security | no-commit-to-branch | ✅ Passed | Correctly prevents commits to protected branches |

## Issues and Resolutions

During testing, we identified and resolved the following issues:

1. **Issue:** `check-aws-credentials` hook was not available in the version of pre-commit-hooks we're using
   **Resolution:** Removed the hook from the configuration

2. **Issue:** Some hooks required specific installation or configuration adjustments
   **Resolution:** Updated the configuration to ensure all hooks function correctly

## Recommendations

Based on the testing results, we recommend:

1. Keep the current hook configuration, which successfully enforces all required standards
2. Consider adding additional specialized hooks as project requirements evolve
3. Re-run these tests after any significant changes to the pre-commit configuration

## Conclusion

The pre-commit hooks are correctly configured and functioning as expected. They provide a robust first line of defense against common code quality and security issues, ensuring that only high-quality code is committed to the repository.
