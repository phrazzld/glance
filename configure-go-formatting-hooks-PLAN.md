# T003: Configure Go-specific formatting hooks

## Task Description
Add go-fmt hook to the pre-commit config to enforce Go formatting standards.

## Approach
1. Examine the current .pre-commit-config.yaml structure
2. Add or update the Go-specific formatting hooks in the Go section:
   - go-fmt: For basic Go formatting according to the Go standard
   - go-imports: To handle import organization and additional formatting
3. Set appropriate options for each hook:
   - Ensure they run on all Go files
   - Configure with appropriate arguments if needed
4. Document the changes with comments in the YAML file
5. Validate the configuration to ensure it's properly formed
