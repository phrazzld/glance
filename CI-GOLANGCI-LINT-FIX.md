# CI Failure Analysis: golangci-lint Configuration Error

## Summary

The CI pipeline is failing on the "Run golangci-lint" step with a configuration validation error:

```
jsonschema: "issues" does not validate with "/properties/issues/additionalProperties": additional properties 'exclude' not allowed
```

## Root Cause

When using golangci-lint v2.1.2, certain configuration properties that were valid in older versions are no longer supported. The error message suggests there's a property named `exclude` in the `issues` section, but it's not shown in the current configuration file. This could be due to:

1. An invisible or control character in the file
2. A schema validation issue in golangci-lint v2.1.2 regarding the `new` property
3. A compatibility issue between the configuration schema and the specific version

## Resolution Steps

I'll update the `.golangci.yml` configuration to ensure it's compatible with golangci-lint v2.1.2 by:

1. Simplifying the `issues` section and removing potentially problematic properties
2. Ensuring all properties in the configuration are explicitly supported in v2.1.2

Here's the fix I'll implement:

```yaml
# Optimized golangci-lint configuration for v2.1.2
# Performance-focused configuration for Go 1.23+ compatibility

# Modern golangci-lint v2.x configuration
version: "2"

run:
  # Timeout for running linters
  timeout: 2m
  # Don't run on test files
  tests: false
  # Allow analysis of large codebases
  allow-parallel-runners: true
  allow-serial-runners: true

# Only enable specific linters with explicit configuration
linters:
  enable:
    # Essential linters
    - errcheck          # Check for unchecked errors
    - govet             # Examine code for suspicious constructs
    - ineffassign       # Detect unused assignments
    - staticcheck       # Static analysis checks
    - unused            # Find unused variables, functions, etc.
    # Additional useful linters
    - misspell          # Find commonly misspelled words
    - gosec             # Security checks

# Configure specific linter settings
issues:
  max-same-issues: 3
  max-issues-per-linter: 10
```

The key change is removing the `new: true` property from the `issues` section, which might be causing the validation error in v2.1.2.

## Additional Notes

1. The golangci-lint v2.x schema is more strict compared to v1.x, and some properties may have been renamed or removed
2. For future reference, we should check the official golangci-lint documentation for the specific version we're using to ensure configuration compatibility
