# Task Plan: Configure Workflow Triggers

## Task ID and Title
**T018:** Configure workflow triggers

## Approach

After examining the existing workflows, I've noticed that the workflow triggers are already configured for all four workflows (precommit.yml, test.yml, lint.yml, and build.yml). All workflows are currently set to trigger on:

1. Push to the master branch
2. Pull requests to the master branch

For test.yml, lint.yml, and build.yml, there are also path-ignore settings to skip unnecessary runs when only documentation is changed.

Since the triggers are already properly configured, I'll focus on:

1. Reviewing the current trigger configuration for completeness and optimization
2. Adding scheduled runs for security-focused workflows
3. Documenting the trigger strategy for future reference

## Implementation Plan

1. Add a scheduled run to the precommit.yml workflow for regular security checks
2. Add a scheduled run to lint.yml for regular dependency checking
3. Optimize the existing path-ignore configurations to reduce unnecessary workflow runs
4. Add workflow concurrency settings to prevent redundant workflow runs
5. Document the trigger strategy in a comment at the top of each workflow file
