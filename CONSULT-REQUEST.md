# Consultation Request: Path Validation Security Implementation

## Original Task ID
**T037 · feature · p1: identify locations requiring path validation**

## Goal
Comprehensively identify all code locations in the Glance codebase that accept file paths from external sources (CLI, config files, environment variables) and document the specific validation requirements for each location to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Problem/Blocker
This task is challenging because:

1. **Safety & Security Focus**: Per our DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md, we must "NEVER Trust Input" and properly validate all external input at system boundaries. Ensuring we identify ALL potential path injection points is critical for security.

2. **Complexity in Identification**: Path handling occurs across multiple packages and may be passed through several abstraction layers, making it difficult to track all entry points and data flow comprehensively.

3. **Validation Strategy Concerns**: Different path types may require different validation strategies, and we need to ensure we identify the appropriate technique for each case.

4. **Existing Suppressions**: There are multiple #nosec G304 suppressions for file path operations that will need proper validation to be safely removed, as highlighted in our recent T036 audit.

## Context/History
- Task T036 (audit all #nosec annotations) was completed, identifying several G304 suppressions related to file path operations in the codebase.
- We identified that proper path validation needs to be implemented to safely remove these suppressions.
- This task is blocking T038 (implement path validation for external inputs) and ultimately T040 (remove unnecessary #nosec suppressions).
- There's a specific issue noted in the "clarifications & assumptions" section titled "Determine all locations accepting external file paths for validation" marked as blocking.

## Key Files
1. `glance.go` - Contains file operations with #nosec suppressions
2. `config/loadconfig.go` - Handles command-line arguments and config loading
3. `llm/prompt.go` - Has suppressions for template file loading
4. `filesystem/reader.go` - Core file reading functionality
5. `T036-audit-results.md` - Contains the audit of #nosec annotations

## Errors
No specific errors, but potential security vulnerabilities if we miss any entry points for file path injection.

## Desired Outcome
A comprehensive document that:
1. Lists all locations in the codebase that accept file paths from external sources
2. For each location, specifies:
   - The source of the path (CLI, config, env var, etc.)
   - The context in which it's used (reading, writing, etc.)
   - The specific validation requirements (cleaning, absolute path conversion, prefix checking, etc.)
   - References to the #nosec annotations that can be removed after validation is implemented

This document will be the foundation for implementing proper path validation in task T038 and will help ensure that we systematically address all potential security concerns.
