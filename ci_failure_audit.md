# CI Failure Audit for PR #3 - Add pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions workflows

## Overview
Pull Request #3 titled "Add pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions workflows" is experiencing a CI failure. While most of the CI checks are passing, the "pre-commit" check is failing. This audit analyzes the failure and provides a resolution.

## Failure Details

### Failed Check
- **Workflow**: Pre-commit Checks
- **Job**: pre-commit
- **Status**: FAILURE
- **Run ID**: 14536894125
- **Job ID**: 40786958096
- **Started**: 2025-04-18T14:43:55Z
- **Completed**: 2025-04-18T14:44:09Z

### Error Analysis
The failure occurs during the Python setup phase of the pre-commit workflow. Specifically, the workflow is looking for Python requirement files but can't find them:

```
##[error]No file in /home/runner/work/glance/glance matched to [**/requirements.txt or **/pyproject.toml], make sure you have checked out the target repository
```

This indicates that the workflow expects to find Python dependency files (either `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) to set up the Python environment properly, but these files are missing in the repository.

### Root Cause
The pre-commit workflow in `.github/workflows/precommit.yml` is configured to use Python with pip caching:

```yaml
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: '3.10'
    cache: pip
```

When `cache: pip` is specified, the action looks for Python dependency files (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) to determine what to cache. Since these files don't exist in the repository, the action fails.

## Implemented Solution

I've implemented the following changes to fix the issue:

1. **Added a `requirements.txt` file** to the repository root with the necessary dependency for pre-commit:
   ```
   pre-commit>=3.0.0
   ```

2. **Updated the GitHub Actions workflow** to use the new requirements file:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install pre-commit
     run: |
       python -m pip install --upgrade pip
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       pre-commit --version
   ```

These changes satisfy the requirements of the `actions/setup-python@v5` action with `cache: pip` and ensure that pre-commit is properly installed.

## Status of Other Checks

All Go-related checks (build, lint, and test) are passing except for Windows builds which were still in progress at the time of the audit. The core functionality of the codebase remains intact.

## Next Steps

1. Commit the changes to the PR branch
2. Re-run the pre-commit workflow
3. Monitor the Windows build checks to ensure they complete successfully

The implementation follows the standards defined in the repository's development philosophy, focusing on maintainability and automation.
