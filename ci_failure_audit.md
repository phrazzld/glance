# CI Failure Audit for PR #3 - Add pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions workflows

## Overview
Pull Request #3 titled "Add pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions workflows" experienced multiple CI failures. While most of the CI checks were passing, there were issues with the "pre-commit" check and Windows builds. This audit analyzes the failures and documents the implemented solutions.

## Initial Failure Details

### Failed Check 1: Pre-commit Python Setup
- **Workflow**: Pre-commit Checks
- **Job**: pre-commit
- **Status**: FAILURE
- **Run ID**: 14536894125
- **Job ID**: 40786958096

### Error Analysis
The failure occurred during the Python setup phase of the pre-commit workflow. Specifically, the workflow was looking for Python requirement files but couldn't find them:

```
##[error]No file in /home/runner/work/glance/glance matched to [**/requirements.txt or **/pyproject.toml], make sure you have checked out the target repository
```

This indicated that the workflow expected to find Python dependency files (either `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`) to set up the Python environment properly, but these files were missing in the repository.

### Root Cause
The pre-commit workflow in `.github/workflows/precommit.yml` was configured to use Python with pip caching:

```yaml
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: '3.10'
    cache: pip
```

When `cache: pip` is specified, the action looks for Python dependency files to determine what to cache. Since these files didn't exist in the repository, the action failed.

## Follow-up Failure Details

After fixing the initial issue, two additional problems were discovered:

### Failed Check 2: Missing goimports Tool
The pre-commit workflow failed because the `goimports` tool was not available:

```
go imports...............................................................Failed
- hook id: go-imports
- exit code: 1

Executable `goimports` not found
```

### Failed Check 3: Secret Detection
The pre-commit workflow's secret detection was flagging a false positive:

```
Detect secrets...........................................................Failed
- hook id: detect-secrets
- exit code: 1

ERROR: Potential secrets about to be committed to git repo!

Secret Type: Secret Keyword
Location:    config/config.go:74
```

## Complete Solution Implemented

I implemented the following changes to fix all issues:

1. **Added a `requirements.txt` file** to the repository root with the necessary dependency for pre-commit:
   ```
   pre-commit>=3.0.0
   ```

2. **Updated the GitHub Actions workflow** to use the new requirements file:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install pre-commit
     run: |
       python -m pip install --upgrade pip
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       pre-commit --version
   ```

3. **Added Go tools installation** to the workflow to ensure `goimports` is available:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install Go tools
     run: |
       go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
   ```

4. **Suppressed the false positive secret detection** in the config file:
   ```go
   newConfig.APIKey = apiKey // pragma: allowlist secret
   ```

## Status of Checks After Fix

After implementing these fixes, the pre-commit hooks passed successfully in the local environment. These changes should resolve the CI failures on the PR.

## Lessons Learned

1. Ensure all required tools for CI checks are explicitly installed in the workflow
2. When using `actions/setup-python@v5` with `cache: pip`, always include a requirements file
3. Use appropriate annotations (like `// pragma: allowlist secret`) to handle false positives in security scanning

The implementation follows the standards defined in the repository's development philosophy, focusing on maintainability, automation, and security.
