## Failure Investigation

### Analysis

1. The `golangci-lint` check is failing in the CI environment but passes locally with the same configuration.

2. Recent commit history shows an attempt to fix golangci-lint compatibility issues:
   - Most recent commit: "Fix golangci-lint compatibility issues with Go 1.24"
   - Previous commits include "Disable golangci-lint in pre-commit" and "Update golangci-lint config"

3. Local environment details:
   - Go version: go1.24.2 darwin/arm64
   - golangci-lint version: 2.1.1 (built with go1.24.2)
   - Local golangci-lint run succeeds with the same configuration

4. CI workflow details:
   - The workflow installs golangci-lint v1.57.0 specifically
   - CI is configured to use Go 1.23 for linting (for "better compatibility")

### Potential Issues

1. **Version Mismatch**: The CI environment uses golangci-lint v1.57.0 while locally we're using v2.1.1, which could explain the difference in behavior.

2. **Configuration Compatibility**: The `.golangci.yml` configuration may have options that work with newer versions but cause issues with v1.57.0. Several configuration options are marked as "deprecated" in comments.

3. **Go Version Differences**: The workflow explicitly uses Go 1.23 for linting while the local environment uses Go 1.24.2. This version difference could cause compatibility issues with golangci-lint.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Update CI Configuration**:
   - Update the golangci-lint version in CI to match the version used locally (v2.1.1)
   - OR align the local development environment with the CI environment

2. **Fix Configuration Issues**:
   - Review the `.golangci.yml` file to remove any deprecated options
   - Ensure configuration is compatible with the golangci-lint version used in CI

3. **Standardize Go Versions**:
   - Consider using the same Go version for both local development and CI
   - Update documentation to specify exact version requirements

4. **Additional Logging**:
   - Add more verbose output to the CI workflow to better diagnose failures

The most straightforward solution is likely updating the golangci-lint version in the CI workflow to match what's working locally (v2.1.1).
